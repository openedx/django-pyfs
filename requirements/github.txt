# This requirement breaks both pip-tools and versioneye. The requirements are
# unchanged from master. It is possible to temporarily change this to fs for
# updating pinned versions using pip-tools, then change it back after, but you
# will have to hand edit the resulting requirements.txt to replace this url
# since it contains changes necessary for Python 3 support.

# The pip-tools issue should be cleared up with this PR (or when we move to a
# full release of pyfilesystem or pyfilsystem2):
# https://github.com/nvie/pip-tools/pull/405
