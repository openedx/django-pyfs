# This requirement breaks both pip-tools and versioneye. The requirements are unchanged from master. It is possible to
# temporarily change this to fs for updating pinned versions using pip-tools, then change it back after, but you will
# have to hand edit the resulting requirements.txt to replace this url since it contains changes necessary for Python 3.
